# tri_training
This git explores the paper "Tri-Training: Exploiting Unlabeled Data Using Three Classifiers" by Zhou and Li (2005).

The git incldes:
an overview presentation (.ppt), 
video walk-through of above presentation,
an experiment applying the technique including Python code.

Tri-Training, like other semi-supervised learning techniques, is a means to allow supervised learning to use unlabeled data. So if you have a little labeled data and lots of unlabeled data, this technique is for you.
