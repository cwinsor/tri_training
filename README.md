# tri_training
This git explores Tri-Training - a semi-supervised learning algorithm introduced by Zhou and Li (Tri-Training: Exploiting Unlabeled Data Using Three Classifiers).
The git incldes:
an overview presentation (.ppt)
video walk-through of above presentation
an experiment applying the technique including Python code

Semi-supervised algorithms like Tri-Training allow re-purposing supervised learning techniques to use advantage of unlabeled data.
